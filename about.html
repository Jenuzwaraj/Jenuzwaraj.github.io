            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello! I'm Jenuzwaraj, an Embedded & IoT Engineer based in Palakkad, Kerala, India. With a passion for technology and innovation, I specialize in developing embedded systems and IoT solutions that bridge the physical and digital worlds.</p>
            <p>My journey into the world of embedded systems began during my academic years, where I developed a keen interest in how software interacts with hardware. Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work on various projects, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Yocto Project â€“ Custom Linux Distro</strong>: Building a custom Linux distribution tailored for specific hardware.</li>
                <li><strong>ESP32 Quadbot</strong>: Developing a quadruped robot using ESP32 for terrain navigation.</li>
                <li><strong>Handwriting Machine</strong>: Creating a precision writing machine using Arduino and 3D-printed parts.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These projects have not only honed my technical skills but also fueled my passion for creating innovative solutions.</p>
