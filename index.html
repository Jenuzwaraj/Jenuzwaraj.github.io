## Why I Chose Yocto Project  
As an embedded and IoT engineer, I often need a lightweight, highly customized Linux for my hardware.  
Instead of relying on pre-built distributions, I wanted to learn how to **build my own Linux image** from scratch.  
That’s where the **Yocto Project** comes in.

---

## What I Did  
- Downloaded **Poky** (Yocto’s reference build system).  
- Set up the build environment on my workstation.  
- Configured **layers** and **recipes** for my specific board.  
- Built a custom **embedded Linux distro** tailored to my project’s requirements.

---

## Highlights of the Build  
- **Layers & Recipes:** Added support for my target board and extra packages.  
- **Toolchain:** Cross-compiled for ARM, ensuring smooth integration with my embedded hardware.  
- **Optimizations:** Removed unnecessary services, reducing boot time and image size.  

---

## Lessons Learned  
- **Layering is power:** Each layer can be isolated, maintained, and reused.  
- **Reproducibility matters:** Using Yocto guarantees a predictable build environment.  
- **Patience pays off:** The first build takes time, but incremental builds are faster.

---

## What’s Next  
- Adding **custom device drivers** into the Yocto build.  
- Automating builds with **CI/CD** on GitHub Actions.  
- Documenting my process so others can follow along.
